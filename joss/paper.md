# Summary

``flight-ad`` is a Python 3 package for anomaly detection in the 
aviation domain built on top of scikit-learn [@scikit-learn].

It provides:
- An implementation of an anomaly detection pipeline;
- Visualization tools for assessing potential anomalies;
- Reporting tools for analyzing model results;
- Sample airplane sensor data (from NASA's DASHlink);
- Sample pipelines such as the DBSCAN pipeline.

## Research

``flight-ad`` is currently being used in the following research:
- add.
